Description: perform partial commits into the Git repository
 A darcsum feelalike for Git provides a mode to do interactive partial
 commits. After running `M-x gitsum' from git controlled buffer, a new
 buffer will created, containing all changes, made in current repository.
 .
 You can kill everything you don't want to commit with `k', navigate
 between hunks with `n' and `p' and between files with `N' and `P'. A whole
 file can be killed with `K'. To refine the patch, split it with `C-c C-s'.
 If you toggle read-only with `C-x C-q', you can edit everything freely; be
 careful about it.
 .
 If you are ready, commit the patch with `C-c C-c' or just `c'. Enter the
 message and press `C-c C-c' again.

 Note: If you want to add files in the commit, use `M-x git-status' from
 Official Git distribution's (contrib) git.el, add the files with `a', then
 switch to gitsum with `s'. You can only add files as a whole. You need
 git.el from the git repository then.
 .
