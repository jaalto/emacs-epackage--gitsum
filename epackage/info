Description: perform partial commits into the Git repository
 A darcsum feelalike for Git provides a mode to do interactive partial
 commits. User should run `M-x gitsum' from buffer with file, registered in
 the Git repository. And after execution of this command, a new buffer will
 created, containing all changes, made in current repository.
 .
 Run `M-x gitsum' inside a Git repository and kill everything you don't
 want to commit with `k'. You can navigate easily between hunks with `n'
 and `p' and between files with `N' and `P'. A whole file can be killed
 with `K'. If you want to refine the patch, you can split it with `C-c
 C-s'. If you toggle read-only with `C-x C-q', you can edit everything
 freely (be careful!).
 .
 If you are ready, commit the patch with `C-c C-c' or just `c'. Enter the
 message and press `C-c C-c' again.

 Note: If you want to add files in the commit, use `M-x git-status' from
 Official Git distribution's (contrib) git.el, add the files with `a', then
 switch to gitsum with `s'. You can only add files as a whole. You need
 git.el from the git repository then.
 .
 Note: 2013-06-03 the code hasn't been touched since 2008.
